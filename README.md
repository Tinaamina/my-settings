## my-settings

1. `.bash_profile` file for several bash settings  
2. `.vimrc.local` file for macvim. I use [spf13](http://vim.spf13.com) distribution, so not much to set up by myself. 
I only change the font and size, and disabled code folding. 
3.  `.emacs.d` folder and  `.latexmkrc` file for setting up emacs for latex. Check out the file
[Emacs-for-Latex.md](https://github.com/reijz/my-settings/blob/master/.emacs.d/Emacs-for-Latex.md).
