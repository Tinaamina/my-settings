## my-settings

1. `.bash_profile` file for several bash settings  
2. `.vimrc.local` file for macvim. I use [spf13](http://vim.spf13.com) distribution, so no much to set up by myself. 
I only change the font and size, and disabled code folding. 
3.  `.emacs` and  `.latexmkrc` files for setting up emacs for latex.
